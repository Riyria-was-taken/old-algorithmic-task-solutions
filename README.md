# old-algorithmic-task-solutions
My solutions from high school, which I wrote in order to prepare to Olympiad in Informatics and to have fun.

Those codes are often very ugly and they don't have comments too, cause we had limited time to solve the problems,
they only had to work, so please forgive me their form.

I'm publicising them in order to somehow store and organize small part of them for which I'm able to find stories and deduce which task they were connected to. (I implemented more than 600 solutions for various tasks during high school and, unfortunately, I haven't thought about organizing or describing them in any way). I hope they will be useful ones who will look for answer to questions. Also I would be grateful if some would appreciate my work.

IMPORTANT: I'm countinuously trying to develop this repository during my free time, but I must admit that I don't have a lot of it.
